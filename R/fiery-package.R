#' A Fiery Framework for R-Based Web Development
#' 
#' Fiery is a lightweight and flexible framework for web servers build on top
#' of the \link{httpuv} package. The framework is largely event-based, letting
#' the developer attach handlers to life-cycle events as well as defining and
#' triggering their own events. This approach to development is common in 
#' JavaScript, but might feel foreign to R developers. Thankfully it is a rather
#' simple concept that should be easy to gradually begin to use to greater and
#' greater effect.

#' @seealso \code{\link{Fire}} for the main approach to build your server logic
