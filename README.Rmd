Fiery is a flexible and lightweight framework for building web servers in R. It
is relatively unopinionated about how you chose to build your server logic and
supports many use cases, from serving static files to being used as a base for a
model-view-controller based setup.

## How to install this
Install the release from CRAN using `install.packages('fiery')` or get the
development version directly from GitHub using `pak`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages('pak')
pak::pak('thomasp85/fiery')
```

## Design
Fiery is designed around a clear server life-cycle with events being triggered
at specific points during the life-cycle that will call the handlers attached to
these events. In addition to the life-cycle events, it is possible to trigger
custom events and attach handlers to these as well. Fiery is designed with
modularity in mind so that plugins can be developed for different tasks and
mixed and matched to suit the specific project.

While the intro might indicate that fiery is difficult to use, this is not the
case. Much of the hard work of handling http requests has been encapsulated in
the [`reqres`](https://github.com/thomasp85/reqres) that fiery uses to handle
http requests and responses. Further, A plugin that will often be used
is [`routr`](https://github.com/thomasp85/routr), which provides powerful routing
of HTTP requests, thus simplifying the server logic even more.

## A minimal example
Following is a very *Hello World*-ish example of a fiery app (sans `routr`),
that showcases some of the different life-cycle events:

```{r}
library(fiery)

# Create a New App
app <- Fire$new()

# Setup the data every time it starts
app$on('start', function(server, ...) {
    server$set_data('visits', 0)
    server$set_data('cycles', 0)
})

# Count the number of cycles (internal loops)
app$on('cycle-start', function(server, ...) {
    server$set_data('cycles', server$get_data('cycles') + 1)
})

# Count the number of requests
app$on('before-request', function(server, ...) {
    server$set_data('visits', server$get_data('visits') + 1)
})

# Handle requests
app$on('request', function(server, request, ...) {
    response <- request$respond()
    response$status <- 200L
    response$body <- paste0('<h1>This is indeed a test. You are number ', server$get_data('visits'), '</h1>')
    response$type <- 'html'
})

# Show number of requests in the console
app$on('after-request', function(server, ...) {
    message(server$get_data('visits'))
    flush.console()
})

# Terminate the server after 50 cycles
app$on('cycle-end', function(server, ...) {
    if (server$get_data('cycles') > 50) {
        message('Ending...')
        flush.console()
        server$extinguish()
    }
})

# Be polite
app$on('end', function(server) {
    message('Goodbye')
    flush.console()
})

app$ignite(showcase = TRUE)
```

In general much of the logic will happen in the `request` and `message` handlers
and you are free to ignore the other life-cycle events if they are not needed.
