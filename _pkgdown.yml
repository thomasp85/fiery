  - title: "The Fire object"
    desc: >
      fiery is build on top of the R6 class system and all functionality in the
      package is more or less part of the Fire class. The understanding of this
      class is thus integral to understanding fiery.

  - title: "Logging"
    desc: >
      Logs are an important part of many servers and fiery has a central logging
      facility where callbacks and handlers can send logging information to 
      without worrying about where and how the logs get written.
    contents:
      - loggers
  - title: "Request and response objects"
    desc: >
      A lot of the logic in web servers are concerned with parsing requests and
      building up responses. fiery uses the Request and Response classes defined
      in the [reqres](https://github.com/thomasp85/reqres) package. See the
      documentation there.
  - title: "Routing"
    desc: >
      A central part of many servers is the router that takes care of recieving
      requests and directing them at the right handlers for further processing. 
      Being the minimal server framework that it is, fiery doesn't include 
      router functionality itself, but the 
      [routr](https://github.com/thomasp85/routr) package.
